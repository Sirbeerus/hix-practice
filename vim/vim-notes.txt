--vim (command mode configurations)
Syntax highlighting is very useful. The next line we add will enable syntax highlighting and make your code easier to read.

" Turn syntax highlighting on.
:syntax on (command mode)

You can also choose to display line numbers to make navigating the file easier.

" Add numbers to each line on the left-hand side.
:set number (command mode)

:set spell spelllang=en_us (command mode)

:set relativenumber
:set mouse=a (use mouse)
:colorscheme
:set autoindent

ctrl r   (redo)

v (visual mode) y (yanking/copy) p (pasting)



-----------------------------------------------

--vimrc configuration file
vi ~/.vimrc
Just open the file as shown, then add the syntax on statement somewhere in the file.

____________________________

When you start Vim, it first processes your .vimrc file, and then it scans all directories in ~/.vim for plugins contained in pack/*/start.

By default, your ~/.vim directory (if you even have one) has no such file structure, so set that up with:

$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
Now you can place Vim plugins in ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start, and they'll automatically load when you launch Vim.

/s z=   (spelling errors)

-----------------------------

There's persistent undo option in vim, :h persistent-undo

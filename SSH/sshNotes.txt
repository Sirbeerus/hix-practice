SSH --(keygen generation terminal)


ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C youremail@domain.com
-t is the cryptographic algorithm

-b is the byte size of key (I won't recommend using 2048)

-C is comment. Please read below portion to understand significance of comment.

ssh-keygen will by default write keys in an OpenSSH-specific format. This format is preferred as it offers better protection for keys at rest as well as allowing storage of key comments within the private key file itself. The key comment may be useful to help identify the key. The comment is initialized to “user@host” when the key is created, but can be changed using the -c option.


everyone forgets to mention that u need to run ( *** ssh-add *** ) after creating a key on the computer you are connecting from. that is what causes a headache to most people

#keys random art image is.for humans to easily compare

Login via SSH (optional)

If you prefer SSH instead of the Vultr Web Console, it's possible to temporarily authorize a SSH key for the nixos account during the installation by adding it to /home/nixos/.ssh/authorized_keys.

If you have your public SSH key uploaded to GitHub, for example, you can do the following:

$ mkdir ~/.ssh
$ curl -L https://github.com/<username>.keys >~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Log in via SSH as the nixos user.

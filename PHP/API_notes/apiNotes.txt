pre req. chrome extension json viewer..
apis are a mix of both, some private (pay), many are public by design but not promoted and you have to find it yourself
when you right-click and view source, you can mess with anything and it renders in your browser. it's just interacting with your browser, not the site

i think with apis mostly it's me looking for information... what do I want first? ok i want to know if there's a way I can grab all the listings from jpg.store for a project without scraping it. so i open up my browser and visit jpg.store. i look for any signs of an API available, usually in the footer. if not, i right-click, open developer console (dev console) and click Network tab. from there I look for another tab to filter on XHR requests or Fetch.  Then i reload the page.
in chrome it's right-click > inspect
click network
and Fetch/XHR

footer of the website (not source)
usually has all the links for developers
jpg doesn't
so i open the dev console
it says to reload, so i'm going to do that now and show you
all these requests show up now

pick something and look at Preview to see the data
if you find something you find interesting, click Header to get the request info
and in your code, you just try to code that request info
i will do total.json to show you
Image
i clicked total.json, that's it so far
on the right it opened a page showing me the preview
now i'm going to click Header just to the left of Preview
and I see this
Request URL: https://pool.pm/total.json
so that is an ajax request from jpgstore to pool.pm to grab that json file
you can just click it too and see the same info
so pool is providing us with some good info here

we can always grab that file if we need to know the conversion rates, how many tokens are listed, how many policies, etc..
oh and the load averages
--------------
it can be useful to think in terms of using GET for retrieving / viewing information and POST for creating / editing information.

Search

First things first — you NEED instant operator documentation lookup. If you’re on a Mac, this can be done via Alfred and Dash. Setup is on your own, but to motivate you, searching for a Lens operator like ^. can be done via [cmd]+[space] hs ^..

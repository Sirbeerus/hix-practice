i make a backup copy of my dirs sometimes with rsync.
rsync -avz Programming/ ProgrammingBak/
[5:36 PM]
then I can do whatever I want with Programming/ without worry

that'll do it

i like to use rsync because it can resume where you left off if you got interrupted or had to control-C to stop it
[5:40 PM]
rsync will do a comparison check between Programming/ and ProgrammingBak/ and make sure they are mirrored

-avz
 - a, archive
 - v, verbose
 - z, gzip/compress the contents between transfers
[5:41 PM]
you can skip -z for local only transfers, i usually just leave it, it doesn't hurt
